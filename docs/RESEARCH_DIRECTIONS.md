# Research directions

Updated: 2026-09-10

This is a living portfolio, not a queue that must be executed in order. Agents
are welcome to add, remove, split, merge, or re-rank branches as the production
scope, literature, implementation evidence, or computational resources change.
Record why a branch moved; do not preserve a stale ranking for consistency.

## Current diagnosis

The corrected evidence suggests that the dominant unresolved problem is the
combination of convection-dominated spatial transport and positivity
enforcement. This is `NUMERICAL`, not proved: controlled error decomposition may
revise it. Initialization and projected Bayesian analysis have improved, while
the current Q1 covariance discrepancy remains much larger than the Monte Carlo
noise floor. The prior Q1/Q2 result matched global DOFs while changing physical
cell widths and timestep, so it cannot decide the polynomial-degree question.

## Active branches

| Branch | Why it matters now | Switch/stop evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Same-mesh Q2 falsification | Isolates degree, timestep and positivity-certificate effects using one represented initial law. | Advance Q2 only under the predeclared covariance, marginal, limiter, timestep and invariant gates in `METHOD_SELECTION_REPORT.md`. |
| Adaptive Q2 Bernstein diagnosis | Separates a sufficient positivity certificate from witnessed negativity and unresolved near-zero cases. | Use as a diagnostic; reject it as a production decision procedure if unresolved cells dominate or correction remains intrusive. |
| Local AFC/convex high-order DG | Limits conservative antidiffusive fluxes locally instead of scaling a completed polynomial globally. | Start only if raw same-mesh Q2 is accurate; require full-SPD Lorenz boundary applicability. |
| Positive full-tensor finite volume | Provides an operator-level positivity fallback with substantially different numerical principles. | Start if raw Q2 fails; require genuine 3-D convection-diffusion, no-flux and high-Peclet validation. |
| FCDF or directional complete flux | Directly targets drift-diffusion flux and high-Peclet numerical diffusion. | Keep as an identity/diagonal `B` special-case branch; present FCDF proof is directional and its 2026 evidence is lower-dimensional. |
| Characteristic/semi-Lagrangian methods | Could reduce upwind transport diffusion substantially. | Require a defensible 3-D diffusion, positivity, conservation, and reflecting-boundary treatment. |
| Goal-oriented/nonuniform resolution | Mean and raw second moments are linear functionals, so covariance-oriented refinement may beat uniform grids. | Reconsider if current DOLFINx topology or estimator cost prevents a controlled implementation. |
| Dynamically scaled Hermite reference | Supplies a whole-space, high-order method independent of DG/FV and avoids reflecting truncation. | Validate by coefficient decay and moment refinement; use as a reference even if positivity prevents production use. |
| Monte Carlo plus density reconstruction | Strong independent moment reference and possible production challenger. | Compare full-density reconstruction, tails, bandwidth bias, repeatability, and cost - not moments alone. |

## Comparison principles

- Compare identical initial laws, physical parameters, domains, forecast
  intervals, and requested observables.
- Compare equal physical mesh as well as equal degrees of freedom, wall time,
  and memory; each answers a different question.
- Triangulate with Monte Carlo and a genuinely independent deterministic
  reference where possible.
- Separate initialization, analysis, propagation, space, time, boundary,
  limiter, export, and reference uncertainty.
- Do not call a discrepancy below the reference noise floor a measured solver
  error; increase reference resolution or report that it is unresolved.
- Mature post-burn-in DA states are the decisive deployment distribution, but
  regenerate them after changes to the analysis or positivity path.

## Review triggers

Review this file whenever:

- a candidate passes or fails a controlled gate;
- the intended scope of `B` is clarified;
- a literature audit changes applicability;
- a new DOLFINx or external solver capability changes feasibility;
- hardware or cost constraints change;
- mature-state evidence contradicts startup-state rankings; or
- a new idea offers a credible way to reduce the dominant error.

When reviewing, also update `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`, `docs/CLAIMS.md`,
`docs/DECISIONS.md`, and `docs/assumptions.yaml` as needed.
